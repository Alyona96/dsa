    <h1>When did ballet start?</h1>
    <h2>The ballet is wonderful!
      </p>
    <p>The first mention of the ballet dates back to the XV century, there is information that the court dance teacher Domenico da Piacenza proposed to combine several dances for the next ball, writing a solemn finale to them and designating it as a ballet.

      However, the genre itself emerged a little later in Italy. The starting point is recognized as 1581, it was at this time in Paris that Baltasarini staged his performance based on dance and music.In the 17th century, mixed performances (Opera and ballet) became popular. At the same time, more importance in such productions is given to music, and not to dance. It is only thanks to the reformist work of the French choreographer Jean Georges Nover that the genre takes on a classical shape with its own "choreographic language". </p>
